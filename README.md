# Tutorials

This repository is intended to share knowledge I've gleaned from graduate school topics in machine learning and R programming to my professional career in survey research. The tutorials linked are PDF documents, but you're always welcome to dive into each tutorial's respective subfolder to look at the source code as a .Rmd file.
